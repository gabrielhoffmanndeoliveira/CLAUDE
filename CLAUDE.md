# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository status

This repository holds no application source. It is the working root for a
consulting engagement on **thefirealarmsupplier.com** (TFAS), a US Shopify Plus
fire-alarm parts distributor with roughly 19,440 active products. All product
data lives in Shopify and is reached through the Shopify MCP server; the only
files tracked here are this guidance file and `.gitignore`.

## Standing instruction

**Run the enrichment pipeline continuously until the project is complete. Do not
stop between batches to ask permission, and do not sit idle waiting.** When a
batch of research agents is running, use that time to prepare the next slice,
run audits, or apply queued fixes. Report findings as they land; do not pause
for approval to continue.

The one standing exception: changes to **structured product data** that feed
Google Merchant Center (the `vendor`/brand field, product type, pack counts
asserted in titles) are flagged for the owner rather than applied unilaterally.
Description and title corrections need no approval.

## The enrichment pipeline

Goal: replace thin product descriptions with verified copy, working down a
priority list ranked by six-month Search Console impressions.

**The live queue is `ranked_v2_byscore.json`, not `ranked.json`.** See *The
priority list was defective* below: `ranked.json` was built with two
undocumented filters that hid the highest-traffic thin pages, and it is retired.
Its first 555 positions were published (18-21 Sep 2026) and are excluded from
the v2 list; **positions 555-654 of the old list were deliberately abandoned**,
because those 100 products carry 2,888 impressions between them against
1,424,884 still waiting in v2. Do not resume the old list.

Working files live outside the repo, in `/tmp/tfas/enrich/`:

- `ranked_v2_byscore.json` — **the live queue**, 5,074 candidates sorted by
  `impressions x (1 - chars/700)`. Record shape:
  `{"id","handle","title","vendor","type","sku","price","vis","inv","impr","rev","created","score"}`
- `ranked.json` — retired. Kept only as the record of what was published first,
  and as the baseline source for `/tmp/tfas/BASELINE_555_publicadas.csv`.
- `catalogo_full.json` (in `/tmp/tfas/`) — all 16,031 active products with their
  full descriptions, from `bulkOperationRunQuery`. Re-pull it before rebuilding
  the queue; it is a snapshot, not live.
- `v2bNN/slice.json` — the 18-product slice for batch NN
- `v2bNN/agent{1,2,3}.json` — per-agent research output
- `v2bNN/varsA.json`, `v2bNN/varsB.json` — validated publish payloads, 9 each
- `pending_fixes.md` — corrections queued against already-published pages

**Progress: 627 pages published** — 555 from the old list plus v2b01 through
v2b04 — covering 459,967 impressions.

**Never hand-transcribe product ids into an agent briefing.** On v2b03 all six
ids typed into the prose of one briefing were wrong &mdash; transcribed by eye
from a slice listing and scrambled. Two of the wrong ids were *other real
products in the same batch*, so had the agent trusted the prose it would have
published thermostat copy onto the wrong thermostat pages: plausible-looking,
silent, and discoverable only by chance later. Nothing broke solely because the
briefing also said "read the ids from `aN_in.json`, which is authoritative".

The rule that follows: **a briefing names products by SKU and points at
`aN_in.json` for every id.** Never paste an id, and never write "id X is NOT
yours" corrections &mdash; they were themselves wrong. Agents must take `id`
from the input file and echo it back, and the merge step must assert that each
returned `id` matches the input file before anything is published.

Batch loop: slice 18 products → split 6/6/6 across three concurrent
`general-purpose` research agents → validate → merge → publish in two aliased
`productUpdate` mutations of nine.

### Publishing

Use `mcp__Shopify__graphql_mutation` with aliased batch mutations (`u0:`, `u1:` …),
nine per request. The input type is **`ProductUpdateInput!`** (not `ProductInput!`),
and the tool parameter holding the document is **`query`** (not `mutation`).

### House style for `descriptionHtml`

One single-line string, no newlines.

1. `<p><strong>Brand PartNumber</strong> &mdash; one-line identification.</p>`
2. One context paragraph: what the part does and why it exists.
3. `<ul>` of 4–7 verified specs.
4. Closing paragraph naming the specific sibling parts a buyer could confuse it with.

- 700–1100 visible characters (tags stripped); hard ceiling 1230.
- Tags allowed: `<p> <ul> <li> <strong> <sub> <em>` only. No headings, links, attributes.
- Entities allowed: `&mdash; &quot; &times; &deg; &micro; &ndash; &nbsp; &#937;` only.
- No raw `"` or `'` characters. Use `&quot;` for inches.
- Titles: `Brand PartNumber Descriptive Name, qualifiers`.

### Research rules given to every agent

- Never invent a number, dimension, current draw, listing, temperature, or compatibility.
- Never trust search snippets, reseller pages, Amazon, or AI summaries for specs.
  Download the manufacturer PDF with `curl` and extract locally with `pymupdf`.
  For scrambled tables use `page.find_tables()` or `page.get_text("words")` with
  coordinates; when the text layer fails, render the page at 300 dpi and read it.
- **Simplex documents: use the Johnson Controls document hub.** A GET on
  `https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/simplex/api/khub/documents?search=<term>`
  returns a JSON index of ~961 Simplex documents with `title` and
  `documentApiEndpoint`. `search` and `limit` are effectively ignored, so it
  returns the whole index &mdash; grep the JSON rather than trusting ranking.
  Download with `https://docs.johnsoncontrols.com/simplex/api/khub/documents/<id>/content`
  (note the `/simplex/` segment; the bare `/api/` path 404s). This reaches
  current datasheets that are not otherwise linkable, and it settled the 4081
  end-of-line range in one call after four other documents had left a gap.
- **Eaton and Wheelock block `curl`.** Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 with browser
  headers fail against eaton.com (INTERNAL_ERROR or empty reply) and WebFetch
  gets 503. This is Eaton-side bot protection, not a proxy fault. What works is
  Python `urllib` through `HTTPS_PROXY` with a Safari user-agent. The Anixter
  mirror `objects.eanixter.com` serves verbatim Eaton PDFs as a fallback but
  carries superseded revisions &mdash; it had the 2016 MT4 datasheet describing
  xenon flashtubes where the current one specifies LED.
- **The sibling part is the dominant failure mode.** Part numbers differ by one
  character and describe different products. Find the full ordering table and
  confirm which row is this exact part before writing anything.
- **The Omega trap:** `Ω` often extracts as the letter `W`. An extracted "50W" in
  a resistance spec is almost always 50 Ω. Hit three times so far.
- **The dropped-decimal trap:** a title copied from the adjacent catalogue row
  loses a decimal point and asserts a value ten times too large. Edwards lists
  `EOL-4.7` (4.7 kΩ) and `EOL-47` (47 kΩ) on consecutive rows; the store's
  EOL-4.7 page carried the EOL-47 text while separately stocking the real EOL-47.
  A full scan of the 19,440 active products found exactly one such case, so the
  pattern is closed catalogue-wide, but it recurs whenever a new row is copied.
- **The generation trap:** one document number can cover two product generations
  at different revisions. Confirm the revision covers the part.
- Never state stock, lead time, or condition.
- Unverifiable claims go in an `unverified` array with the reason, never in the copy.
- Always ask agents to contradict the briefing. Six of the coordinator's own
  premises have been proven wrong this way; that is the point.

## Conventions

- Battery capacity, pack counts, and fiber mode (single vs multi) in titles are
  the highest-risk fields. Verify them against a manufacturer document every time.
- Do **not** add "Non-Fire", "(Security)", or "Not Fire Rated" to product titles.
  Owner's decision. Such warnings belong in the description body only. Using a
  manufacturer's own product name is fine even when it contains such a word.
- Scratch scripts and datasheet PDFs produced during research are gitignored.

## Catalog state (21 Sep 2026)

19,442 products total: **16,031 active, 3,411 archived**. The archive wave
completed: 701 ROHN plus 2,708 mature candidates imported via Matrixify.

## Demand data: the full Ahrefs sweep

Every SKU in the catalog (19,438 distinct) was measured against Ahrefs US search
volume. **1,522 SKUs carry demand of ≥20/month, totalling 120,600 searches.**
Results live in `/tmp/tfas/demanda_ahrefs_COMPLETO.csv`.

Top vendors by demand: Resideo 290 SKUs / 20,400 per month; Honeywell Home 53 /
18,360; System Sensor 162 / 13,010; BRK Electronics 41 / 9,710; Notifier 121 /
7,070; Fire-Lite 65 / 6,000; Simplex 100 / 4,550; Aiphone 63 / 4,160.

### Method traps proven by this sweep

- **Selection effect.** An earlier sweep covered only 8,763 SKUs and found a 2%
  hit rate. That population was *defined* as zero-impression and zero-stock, so
  the low rate was built in. The live catalog hits 36%. Never infer catalog-wide
  demand from the archive-screening population.
- **Catalog SKU suffixes.** Resideo and Honeywell SKUs carry `/u`, `/b`, `/e`,
  `/a`. Querying them literally returns nothing. Strip the suffix first — doing so
  uncovered the entire Resideo hydronic and thermostat line.
- **Numeric part numbers are not uniformly dead.** Simplex, Notifier and
  Fire-Lite numerics have real volume (`4098-9714` at 350/month). Kidde Fenwal,
  Hochiki, Apollo and Det-Tronics numerics return essentially zero — 1 hit across
  ~1,900 Det-Tronics part numbers.
- **The 100-row cap.** `keywords-explorer-overview` silently truncates at the
  `limit`. When a batch returns exactly 100 rows, re-run ascending and, if still
  capped, with a raised threshold. Five of thirteen batches capped.
- **Short SKUs are noise.** Bare acronyms (`spc` 78k, `bcm` 60k, `csb` 24k, `l1`
  6.5k, `rome` 234k) return real volume for unrelated subjects. Exclude SKUs under
  4 characters and keep a noise list.

## Collections

204 collections exist. Only ~50 rank for anything, together drawing roughly
1,000 visits per month. Analysis in `/tmp/tfas/oportunidade_colecoes.csv`.

**Generic category terms are the wrong target.** "covers" (34,000/month) is
noise; the page actually ranks #5 for **"fire alarm cover"** (350/month). The
qualifier carries the commercial intent.

**But the qualified terms do not convert into a collection-page opportunity
either.** Three SERPs were read before writing any copy, and all three killed the
premise:

- **"duct smoke detector"** (800/month, KD 0, collection at position 23). Page one
  is YouTube, a Honeywell PDF, a People Also Ask box, Google Shopping carousels
  and two code/informational articles. The only retailer category pages are
  Ferguson at #5 and Jackson Systems at #7.
- **"fire alarm battery"** (3,000/month, KD 0). Intent is a homeowner with a
  chirping smoke alarm: First Alert's "How to Replace 9V Batteries" article pulls
  2,859 visits, then Shopping carousels, PAA, Amazon, Reddit and Quora. One
  commercial category page in the whole top ten, at #8. TFAS sells SLA panel
  batteries to contractors — wrong audience.
- **"fire alarm annunciator"** (900/month). Page one is YouTube, PAA ("What is an
  annunciator", "Is it required"), Honeywell's Australian site, two eBay listings
  and three forum threads. **No e-commerce category page at all.**

Three lessons, all costly if missed:

1. **KD does not measure SERP features.** A KD 0 term whose page one is video,
   PAA and Shopping has almost no organic real estate. Read the SERP before
   valuing a keyword.
2. **Where commercial results appear, they are individual product listings** —
   Google Shopping, eBay, Amazon — not category pages. Positions 3 to 5 on these
   terms draw only 30 to 60 visits per month.
3. **This validates the product-page pipeline over a collection frontier.** The
   1,522 SKUs with part-number demand are the real asset, because part-number
   searchers are qualified buyers and product pages are what rank for them.

The collection work worth doing is therefore narrow: the pages already ranking
3–7 for qualified long-tail ("fire alarm cover" #5, "commercial smoke detector"
#3, "pull down fire alarm" #7) earn 80–100 visits each and can be nudged. The
implied redirect is **Google Merchant Center**, since Shopping owns the
commercial slots — which ties directly to the structured fields already flagged
for the owner (vendor/brand, product type, pack counts).

`/collections/simplex?page=12` ranks #2 for "simplex fire alarm" (900/month) and
is the single biggest collection traffic source at 212 visits. A paginated page
holding a head term is fragile — any catalog reorder moves it.

## The priority list was defective — rebuilt as ranked_v2.json

Found 21 Sep 2026 while checking whether the ERP revenue data should reorder
the queue. It should not, but looking for the answer exposed something worse.

`ranked.json` was built with **two undocumented filters**: a description of
**50 characters or less**, and **stock greater than zero**. Every entry obeys
both (max desc 50 chars, min qty 1). Anything in the 51-700 character band was
therefore never a candidate, however thin and however much traffic it drew.
That band holds the most valuable thin pages in the catalogue.

The whole catalogue was then pulled with `bulkOperationRunQuery` (16,031 active
products, 19 seconds, output in `/tmp/tfas/catalogo_full.json`). **The median
active product carries 68 visible characters of description; 13,867 of 16,031
are under 700.**

### ranked_v2.json

Rule: **active, impressions > 0, visible description under 700 characters**,
sorted by impressions descending, stock as a tiebreaker and never a filter.
The 555 pages already published are excluded.

**5,074 candidates carrying 1,537,073 impressions and $39.8M of revenue** —
against the old list's 165,818 impressions. **9.3x larger.** 4,975 of them
were never in the old list at all. The top 100 alone hold 402,142 impressions,
2.4x the entire old project.

| band | products | impressions | revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| A, under 120 chars | 3,274 | 867,989 | $23.9M |
| B, 120-349 chars | 1,322 | 369,054 | $12.1M |
| C, 350-699 chars | 478 | 300,030 | $3.8M |

Work it by `ranked_v2_byscore.json`, which sorts by `impressions x (1 - chars/700)`
so effort lands where both traffic and the text deficit are largest. Batches are
named `v2bNN/`.

Worked examples of what the old filters hid: Notifier AFP-100 (15 chars, 10,211
impressions, excluded by the stock rule), Lenel LNL-1320-S3B (56 chars, 8,201),
Gamewell-FCI MS-7LOB (544 chars, 13,627), Napco SLE-MAX2-FIRE (164 chars, 6,123,
$201,628), Fire-Lite MDF-300 (190 chars, 2,633, $215,312 — its impressions alone
would have ranked it position 3 of the old list).

**The remaining 100 products of the old queue carried 2,888 impressions between
them, 29 each. The first v2 batch of 18 products carries 112,189** — 68% of the
old project's entire impression base in one batch.

**The lesson generalises: never inherit a candidate list without measuring the
filters that built it.** This one was worked for 33 batches before anyone asked
what defined membership.

## The thermostat problem: high traffic, almost no revenue

Measured 21 Sep 2026 after noticing six Honeywell Home thermostats in one v2
slice. The pattern is real and it cuts against a pure impressions sort.

| vendor in the v2 queue | products | impressions | revenue | revenue per impression |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Honeywell Home | 41 | 114,498 | $26,900 | **$0.23** |
| Resideo | 307 | 36,208 | $6,848 | **$0.19** |
| System Sensor | 322 | 127,744 | $6,231,749 | $48.78 |
| Simplex | 467 | 141,783 | $2,983,612 | $21.04 |
| Vesda | 146 | 42,139 | $5,653,956 | $134.17 |

Honeywell Home draws **2,793 impressions per product**, nine times the queue
average of 303, and converts at **1/200th** of the fire alarm core per
impression. Resideo and Honeywell Home together are 348 products and 150,706
impressions against **$33,748 of total revenue**.

They are not a rounding error in the queue: **13 of the first 100 positions and
75,312 of the first 100 positions' 361,237 impressions** are thermostats and
HVAC accessories.

**Two readings, and the available data cannot separate them:**

1. **Wrong audience.** A homeowner searching a thermostat model will not buy
   from a fire alarm distributor. This is the same shape as the "fire alarm
   battery" SERP finding above, where the intent was a homeowner with a chirping
   smoke alarm and TFAS sells SLA panel batteries to contractors.
2. **The pages are too thin to convert**, and enrichment is exactly the fix.

A 200x gap is too large to be explained by page quality alone, but reading 1
cannot be proven from this data either.

**Recommended treatment: a bounded experiment rather than a drift.** These pages
have thousands of impressions each, so unlike the old queue they *can* show an
effect. Do one batch of thermostats, measure at 30 days against the baseline,
and continue only if they convert. Do not let them consume a fifth of the next
five batches by default.

Note this is **not** the earlier rejected idea of sorting by absolute revenue,
which would have surfaced BDA gear nobody searches for. This is revenue *per
impression* on traffic the pages already earn, which is a different test.

## The paid channel nobody had looked at

Checked 21 Sep 2026, after 591 pages of enrichment, via the Windsor connectors
(`google_merchant`, `google_ads`, `searchconsole` are all connected and were
never queried). Last 30 days:

| channel | impressions | clicks | spend | conv. | conv. value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google Ads Performance Max | 2,838,637 | 36,674 | $101,108 | 1,366 | $552,797 |
| Google Ads Search | 7,300 | 344 | $1,631 | 21 | $10,909 |
| **Organic (Search Console)** | **371,907** | **6,537** | **$0** | &mdash; | &mdash; |

**ROAS 5.49x on $102,739 of monthly spend, roughly $1.2M a year.** Paid buys
37,018 clicks at **$2.78 each**; organic earns 6,537 clicks free, 18% of the
paid volume.

**A correction worth recording:** the Merchant Center product-performance report
returns 2,900,556 impressions for the same period, which reads as a free-listing
channel eight times the size of organic. It is not &mdash; it is almost entirely
the same Performance Max traffic. Do not present that figure as earned.

### Why this matters to the enrichment pipeline

**Product title and description are Merchant Center feed attributes, pulled from
Shopify.** Performance Max matches queries against feed content. So every page
this pipeline has rewritten &mdash; and especially the ~350 corrected titles
&mdash; is already feeding a $1.2M-a-year ad channel, not only the organic pages
the project has been measuring.

That makes title accuracy the highest-leverage output of the work, and it means
the errors found so far were costing money in both channels: `FSP1004G` sold as
a 4-zone panel when it is 10-zone, `EOL-4.7` carrying the 47K text, `NP7-12`
claiming a flame-retardant case it does not have.

### The measurement consequence

The feed refreshes about daily, against 30 to 60 days for an organic recrawl.
**The Shopping channel can answer "does enrichment work" in a week or two
instead of two months.** To do that the enriched products have to be separable
in Performance Max reporting &mdash; a `custom_label` on the feed is the normal
mechanism. Per-product performance did **not** come back through the Windsor
`google_merchant` connector (joins on `product_id` returned empty), so the
segmentation has to be set up on the feed side.

### What this does NOT support

The feed is healthy: **16,039 active, 74 disapproved (0.46%), 4 pending.** The
accumulated vendor/brand and product-type decisions are therefore **not blocking
the feed**, which earlier notes implied they might be. They still matter for
relevance matching, but they are not an outage.

## Measurement: there is no evidence yet, by design

Checked 21 Sep 2026: **the entire pipeline is three days old.** The first batch
published 18 Sep, batch 33 on 21 Sep. Google has not recrawled, so **nothing is
yet known about whether enrichment lifts these pages** — neither for nor against.

This is a reason to work high-traffic pages, not low ones. A page with 29
impressions can never demonstrate an effect; the variance swamps it. Pages with
thousands of impressions can.

Baseline captured in `/tmp/tfas/BASELINE_555_publicadas.csv`: all 555 published
pages with their pre-publication six-month impressions (162,930), clicks (2,629)
and average position, plus batch number and publication date.

**Re-measure at 2026-10-21 (30 days) and 2026-11-20 (60 days)** with the Ahrefs
GSC tools against project_id **7227233**. Until then the pipeline is running on
an untested premise, which is acceptable at three days and would not be at sixty.

## Sales data: the ERP export (Jan 2025 to Sep 2026)

The owner supplied `MOST_SOLD_ITEMS_FROM_2025_TO_TODAY.xlsx`, a
sales-by-item export covering **all channels, including the email, phone and
chat orders Shopify never sees**. Saved as `/tmp/tfas/sales_joined.json`.

7,578 items, **$137.7M revenue, 1.6M units**. Joined to the catalogue on a
normalised SKU (strip non-alphanumerics; strip the `/u` `/b` `/e` `/a`
suffixes; strip the Autocall `A` prefix, e.g. `A4098-9714` to `4098-9714`):
**5,406 items matched, carrying 95.6% of the revenue.**

Revenue is concentrated: the top 100 items are 45.7% of it, the top 500 are
76.8%. Top vendors differ sharply from the search-demand ranking &mdash; Vesda
$25.4M, System Sensor $20.9M, Simplex $13.8M, Fire-Lite $11.3M, Notifier
$11.0M.

### What it changes for archiving: the question is closed

Added as a fourth filter after no-stock, no-impressions, no-Ahrefs-demand:

| filter | remaining |
|---|---|
| no stock | 12,977 |
| + no GSC impressions | 9,496 |
| + no Ahrefs demand | 8,604 |
| + **no sale since Jan 2025** | 8,235 |

**369 products worth $1,018,601 were rescued by the fourth filter alone** &mdash;
they would have been archived on the old three-filter rule. The list is in
`/tmp/tfas/RESGATADOS_do_arquivamento.csv`; it is dominated by Fiplex, Westell
and Comba public-safety BDA gear, exactly the relationship-sold categories the
Det-Tronics lesson already warned about.

Of the 8,235 that survive all four filters, only **4 are mature** (created
before April 2026). All four were then checked directly against Shopify
analytics and **all four have transacted**, so **zero products in the catalogue
currently qualify for archiving**.

That includes a correction: Honeywell CPR14 (id 7758172979424), previously
named here as the single archivable product in the catalogue, **sold 2 units
for $122** through a non-Shopify channel. It was only ever a candidate because
the Shopify-only view could not see that order.

**Never run the archive filter without the ERP sales export.** Shopify
analytics alone systematically over-flags the categories that sell offline.

### What it changes for enrichment: less than the headline suggests

The naive read is that the 655-product queue covers only **3.0%** of matched
revenue and should be re-sorted by revenue. That is wrong. 1,438 active
products sell while carrying under 50 impressions, but most have no search
demand either &mdash; they are BDA, flame-detection and Det-Tronics gear bought
through relationships, not Google. Enriching them buys no organic traffic.

The defensible target is the **intersection** of the three signals: sells, has
Ahrefs US search demand, and has few impressions. That is **86 products,
$672,002 in revenue and 4,430 searches per month**, of which **81 sit outside
the current queue**. List in `/tmp/tfas/ALVO_enriquecimento_vendas.csv`.

So sales data is a **second frontier after position 654, not a reordering of
the existing one**. Impressions stay the primary sort inside the current scope,
because a page that already earns impressions is the one enrichment can lift.

## Archiving: the wave is finished

Applying the full filter to the live catalog — no stock, no GSC impressions, no
Ahrefs demand — yields 8,599 candidates, but **8,568 of them were created in
June–August 2026** and are one to three months old.

The maturation curve says that is far too early to judge:

| Age | Share with impressions |
|---|---|
| 1 month | 30% |
| 2 months | 5% |
| 3 months | 8% |
| 6–10 months | 90% |
| 13 months | 97% |
| 36+ months | 94% |

Only **31 candidates are mature, and 30 of them have sold** — including a
Det-Tronics X3301S4N15W1 at $8,062 gross. Exactly one product in the entire
catalog qualifies: Honeywell CPR14 (id 7758172979424), created July 2022, never
sold, no stock, no impressions, no demand.

**Do not archive by search demand alone.** Det-Tronics has ~3,158 products, zero
search demand, and $340,063 in sales across 143 items. That business arrives
through channels other than organic search. The same holds for Space Age
($183,915) and Amerex ($90,825).

Revisit the June–August 2026 cohort around **March 2027**, when it reaches the
6–10 month mark where the impression rate jumps to 90%.
